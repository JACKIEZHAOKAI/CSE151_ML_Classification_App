# MachineLearning_implementation
### Several hand-implemented machine leanring algorithsm applied on different cases 

### 1  KNN 
  train KNN for pixel files representing diff digits 
  
### 2 Decision tree
  Train DT to apply on credit card most popular preference recognition
  Applied pruning to reduce the size of the tree

### 3 perceptron  
  Train basic perceptron, voted perceptron, avg perceptron after several rounds for word detection in dictionary
  find the most popular words in the dictionary 
  built confusion matrix and analyzed
  
### 4 kernel perceptron 
  Improved the prec perceptron with kernel function 
  Applied kernel funciton to reduce computation complexity 
  
### 5 Boosting 
  Built boosting algorithm and trained several rounds  for spam email filtering
